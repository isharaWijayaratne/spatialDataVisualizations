# **Talk on Spatial Data Visualization with RStudio**
---

I delivered a talk for R-Ladies with the goal of introducing undergraduates to the exciting world of spatial data visualization. In this session, I showcased some of the most popular and powerful R packages, including **sp**, **sf**, **leaflet**, **plotly**, and **ggplot2**, demonstrating how they can be used to bring spatial data to life.

To create visually appealing and interactive presentation slides, I leveraged Xaringan, an RMarkdown extension designed for dynamic presentations.

One of the key takeaways from my talk was the importance of visualizing the entire dataset to uncover hidden patterns and gain deeper insights. Effective visualizations are not just about aestheticsâ€”they are about storytelling and discovering the inherent relationships within the data.

Various types of visualizations discussed during this talk are as follows:

Furthermore, I developed a comprehensive [manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oDOCXKad6s70uYlh_Tyhon68yMG_TS7N/view?usp=drive_link) that provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on spatial data visualization.
